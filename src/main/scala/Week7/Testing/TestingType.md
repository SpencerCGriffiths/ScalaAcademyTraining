# Unit Testing VS Integration Testing

Unit Testing:
- Focus on one part of the code in isolation. 
- This should have no side effects allowing for easy isolation
- Quick to run. 
- Sometimes use mocking when there are dependencies i.e. external APIS 
- Mocking allows the focus to solely be on the logic. 

Integration Testing: 
Tests the interface between various parts of the code to make sure they are working correctly 

# Mocking Vs WireMocking

Simulates the environment of an internal dependency.
