# Object Oriented programing 

- Classes 
- Objects 
- Inheritance 
- Traits 

## Classes 

A class is similar to instructions or a blueprint. 

You define a class using the keyword 'class' and the name of the class should start with a capital letter. 

Once made we can add certain behaviours (methods) and attributes inside curly braces {}, These are *members* of the class.

**Syntax:**

1. Class Definition (define the class with the keyword class)
2. Constructor Parameters (these can be specified directly in the class definition)
3. Fields and Methods (define fields and methods inside the class body)

class ExampleClass(val constructorParameter: String, var anotherConstructorParameter: Int) { 

//Method: 
def greet(): 

}

## Traits 

A trait can extend the functionality of a class using a set of methods. 

Unlike a class Scala traits cannot be instantiated and have no arguments or parameters.

You can create an instance of a class but you cannot create an instance of a trait. 

It must be extended/implemented by something else.
